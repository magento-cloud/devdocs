The [Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)][AWS S3] is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. The AWS S3 service uses buckets, or containers, for data storage. This configuration requires you to create a _private_ bucket.

{:.bs-callout-warning}
Magento highly discourages the use of public buckets because it poses a serious security risk.

**Prerequisites for using the AWS S3 adapter**:

1. Create a private bucket for AWS S3.

1. Set up [AWS IAM] roles. Alternatively, you can generate access keys and secret keys.

1. Configure Magento to use the private bucket.

## Nginx configuration

Nginx requires an additional configuration to perform Authentication with the `proxy_pass` directive. Add the following proxy information to the `nginx.conf` file:

```conf
location ~* \.(ico|jpg|jpeg|png|gif|svg|js|css|swf|eot|ttf|otf|woff|woff2)$ {
    # Proxying to AWS S3 storage. 
    resolver 8.8.8.8;
    set $bucket "<bucket-name>";
    proxy_pass https://s3.amazonaws.com/$bucket$uri;
    proxy_pass_request_body off;
    proxy_pass_request_headers off;
    proxy_intercept_errors on;
    proxy_hide_header "x-amz-id-2";
    proxy_hide_header "x-amz-request-id";
    proxy_hide_header "x-amz-storage-class";
    proxy_hide_header "Set-Cookie";
    proxy_ignore_headers "Set-Cookie";
}
```

If you use access and secret keys instead of [AWS IAM] roles, you must include the [`ngx_aws_auth`][ngx repo] Nginx module.
